# C++ Utility Classes

This repository contains four C++ utility classes: `clsInputValidate`, `clsString`, `clsUtil`, and `clsDate`. Each class provides a set of functions to perform common tasks related to input validation, string manipulation, date handling, and general utility operations.

## clsInputValidate

`clsInputValidate` is a utility class for validating user input in C++ programs. It includes functions for checking if a number is between a specified range, reading integers and doubles from the console with error handling, validating dates, and checking for yes or no responses.

## clsString

`clsString` provides functions for manipulating string data in C++. It includes methods for printing the first letter of each word in a string, converting the first letter of each word to uppercase or lowercase, counting the occurrences of small letters, capital letters, vowels, and words in a string, as well as various other string manipulation operations.

## clsUtil

`clsUtil` offers a wide range of utility functions for general-purpose tasks in C++. It includes functions for converting numbers to text, generating random numbers, characters, and keys, filling arrays with random numbers or words, swapping elements in arrays, shuffling arrays, tabulation generation, and text encryption and decryption.

## clsDate

`clsDate` is a utility class for working with dates in C++. It provides functions for validating dates, comparing dates, calculating the difference between two dates, and formatting dates.

## Getting Started

To use these classes in your C++ projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   sh
   git clone https://github.com/kossaychargui/MyCPPLibraries

2. Include the necessary header files in your c++ code:
example:

#include "clsUtil.h"

3. Call the desired functions from the clsUtil namespace in your code.
